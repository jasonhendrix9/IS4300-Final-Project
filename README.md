# IS4300-Final-Project

This project contains the files for the final project in IS4300. Included in the project are the following files:

* _Bean Classification.R_: this file contains the R code to generate everything that is used in the .Rmd file.


* _Bean Classification.Rmd_: this file contains all of the markdown and R code used to generate the final report. The bulk of this file is just a re-ordereding of the contents of the .R file, along with annotations and commentary for the reader. 


* _Bean-Classification.docx_: this is the ouput of the .Rmd file, in the format of a Word document


* _Dry-Bean-Dataset.csv_: this csv file contains all of the data used for the analysis. This file is the direct source of the data in the .R and .Rmd files, so care should be taken before making any changes to this file. This file was originally pulled from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset
